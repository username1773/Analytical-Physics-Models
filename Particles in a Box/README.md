# 3D Particle-in-a-Box Simulations

This folder contains Python scripts for simulating **particles moving inside a 3D box**. The goal is to explore how particles distribute themselves under different potential functions and to study their position profiles.

## Overview

The scripts allow you to:

- Simulate the motion of particles confined in a **3D box**  
- Apply different **potential functions** to influence particle positions  
- Compute **position distributions** and observe how particles settle over time  
- Visualize the 3D trajectories and overall spatial patterns

These simulations provide a simple way to **study particle behavior and density profiles** in a confined space using computational methods.

## Notes
- Code is modular so you can easily try different potentials or numbers of particles.
