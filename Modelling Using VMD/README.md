# Molecular Dynamics Simulations using VMD

This repository contains a collection of **VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics)** simulation files, analysis scripts, and visualization setups.  
The goal is to provide a reference for studying and visualizing molecular systems — from simple molecules to complex biomolecular assemblies — using **VMD**.

## about VMD

**VMD** (Visual Molecular Dynamics) is a molecular visualization program for displaying, animating, and analyzing large biomolecular systems using 3D graphics and built-in scripting.

It is widely used for:
- Visualizing **trajectories** from molecular dynamics simulations.
- Analyzing **structural properties** (RMSD, hydrogen bonds, secondary structures, etc.).
- Preparing **publication-quality molecular graphics** and animations.

After Installing to start up open your console and type "vmd" it will launch the VMD GUI.

There are also many protein structures that already can be loaded into the GUI.
