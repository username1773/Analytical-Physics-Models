# Ideal Electron Simulations

This folder contains Python scripts exploring **Random walks of Electrons** and related statistical properties. The focus is on **Computational Experimentation** to understand electron motion and its probabilistic behavior.

---

## Overview

The simulations implement random walks to model electron trajectories. The scripts allow for:

- Generating **3D random walks** of electrons  
- Creating **Histograms** of positional distributions  
- Calculating **Averages and Statistical properties** of the electron positions  

These models provide a computational way to **visualize randomness, study distributions, and explore statistical behavior** in a simplified physical context.

## Conclusion

From the simulations:

- The **Mean displacement** for one electron for a very large walk is approaching to zero.  
- The **Mean squared displacement** grows linearly with the number of steps \(n\), consistent with standard random walk theory.

## Notes

- The simulations are based on idealized assumptions for electron motion.
